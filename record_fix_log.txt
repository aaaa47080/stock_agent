FIX LOG - December 14, 2025
==========================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Batch analyzer was showing "ERROR" in CSV reports instead of actual trading signals
- The issue was in batch_analyzer.py line where it checked for 'final_decision' key
- The graph workflow returns 'trader_decision' key, not 'final_decision'

SOLUTION APPLIED:
- Changed the condition from: final_state.get('final_decision')
- To: final_state.get('trader_decision')
- This correctly extracts the trading decision from the final state

RESULT:
- ADAUSDT now shows "Hold" signal in CSV
- DOGEUSDT now shows "Buy" signal in CSV with proper entry/exit prices
- Confidence levels and reasoning are properly captured
- No more "ERROR" entries in the reports

FILES MODIFIED:
- D:\okx\stock_agent\batch_analyzer.py
